            <p>The Taj Mahal is one of the most famous historical places in India, which attracts tourists from
                everywhere. Located in Agra, this symbol of love is situated at the bank of river Yamuna. The Taj Mahal
                is an ivory-white marble mausoleum built in 1632 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife
                Mumtaz. This UNESCO World Heritage Site embodies the grand Mughal architecture. The monument’s
                construction began in 1632 and was finished in 1648. The marbles were sourced from Makrana, in
                Rajasthan. The Taj Mahal’s main structure is surrounded by gardens, pools and fountains. The interior
                octagonal chambers are linked with diagonal passages. The interior and exterior of the main building is
                designed with screens, calligraphy, and inlay work. It was built-in semi-translucent white marble with
                intricate carvings and inlay work of precious and semi-precious gems. Precious stones for the monument’s
                inlay came from Egypt, Baghdad, Russia, Golconda, China, Afghanistan, Ceylon, Indian Ocean, and Persia.
                The Taj Mahal is one of the most famous structures in the world and attracts thousands of tourists
                daily.</p>

            <p>The Qutub Minar, Delhi is hailed as the tallest minaret in India. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is also
                known as the ‘Tower of Victory’. Designed with red sandstone and marble, the minaret is known for its
                historical and architectural significance. The historical place in India is an example of the
                Indo-Islamic architecture. The foundation for the structure was laid in 1192 by ‘Qutb-ud-din-Aibak’. It
                was built to celebrate Mohammed Ghori’s victory over Rajput king Prithviraj Chauhan. The tower was
                constructed in three phases and the final phase was done by Firoz Shah Tughlak in 1368. Delhi ruler
                Allauddin Khilji made some additions to the structure in 1315. You can see verses from the Holy Quran
                carved in Kufic style of Islamic calligraphy on the walls. Qutub Minar, 240 ft in height, was built to
                glorify the Muslim kingdom in northern India. It has an iron pillar in its premises, which hasn’t rusted
                even though it is more than 2,000 years old. The Qutub Minar has five unique storeys, which has a
                jutting balcony made up of marble and red sandstone. There is a mosque at the tower base known as
                ‘Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid’, historically India’s first mosque.</p>

            <p>Amer Palace (popularly known as Amer Fort) is a must-visit historical place in Jaipur. Its rich history
                combined with the beautiful landscape attracts tourists from all over the world. You can opt for an
                elephant ride to experience the regal way of entering the Amer Palace. Amer was the erstwhile capital of
                the state, before Jaipur. The fort has influence from both Hindu and Muslim architecture. This fort also
                has ‘Shila Devi’ temple and ‘Ganesh Pol’, a gate that leads to the private palaces of kings. The Amer
                Fort has various pavilions and halls. This UNESCO World Heritage Site was constructed with yellow and
                pink sandstone and has four levels, each having a courtyard. Raja Man Singh built the Amer fort in 1592
                AD and Raja Jai Sigh I expanded and renovated it later. This magnificent fort has withstood many
                invasions. It has four different parts, each having a separate entrance. The main entrance of the Amer
                Fort is the ‘Suraj Pol’ or Sun Gate. The second courtyard is famous for its ‘Diwan-i-Aam’ (public
                audience hall), ‘Sheesh Mahal’, and ‘Sukh Mahal’. </p>

                alt=" Ajanta and Ellora Caves">
            <p>Ajanta and Ellora Caves are among the earliest Buddhist architectures and well-known historical places in
                Maharashtra. The Ajanta caves, numbering 29, were built between the 2nd century BC and 6th century AD.
                The 34 Ellora caves date to the period between the 6th and 11th century AD. It is one of the largest
                rock-cut monastery cave complexes in the world. The paintings and sculptures in the Ajanta and Ellora
                caves, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art that had a
                significant impact on the growth of art in India. Caves from both the places are cut out from the
                volcanic lava of the Deccan plateau. The caves are separated by a distance of 100 kms. While Ajanta is
                mostly about beautiful paintings made on cave walls depicting Buddhism, Ellora is all about sculpture
                and architecture. Ajanta caves have crescent shape in the form of a huge horseshoe. Of the 29 Buddhist
                caves in Ajanta, four were used as Chaitya or prayer halls. The remaining 25 caves were used as Viharas,
                for residential purposes. The Kailasa temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is the largest monolithic
                rock-cut temple in the world.</p>

            <p>Konark Sun Temple is dedicated to the Sun god. The temple is an embodiment of architectural brilliance.
                This temple is also known as the Black Pagoda. It is an incredible masterpiece of architecture that
                attracts tourists from all over the world. The specialty of this temple is the impressive gigantic
                chariot of around 100 ft with wheels and decorated horses carved in stones on each side of the temple.
                The Konark sun temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built by the Eastern Ganga dynasty king,
                Narasimha Deva I, in the 13th century. The temple looks like a chariot with twenty-four wheels and seven
                horses, all carved from stone. Its geometrical patterns and carved wheels served as sundials. The temple
                faces east, so the first rays of sun lit up the main entrance of the temple. Konark is about 35
                kilometres northeast of Puri and 65 kilometres southeast of Bhubaneswar. The stone temple has been
                designed with three types of stone. Chlorite, for doors and frames; Laterite, for platform and
                staircase, and Khondalite was used for other parts of the temple. There are intricate carvings on the
                walls of the main temple, and there is Natya Mandap, which is a separate structure located in front of
                the temple.</p>
